/**
 * <p>
 * AlgorithmFunctions, on top of the core functionality of PotentialsFunctions, describes
 * additional functionality such as molecular dynamics and L-BFGS local optimization.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is implemented in two locations: UIUtils in the User Interfaces package, and in
 * AlgorithmsUtils in the Algorithm package.
 *
 * <p>
 * The UIUtils implementation is the default for Force Field X; on top of the core
 * functionality, it also updates the FFX graphical user interface and tree structure.
 *
 * <p>
 * The AlgorithmUtils implementation lacks the extra functionality of the UIUtils
 * implementation, and simply accomplishes the required task. This is used by our tests, and is
 * also potentially useful for third parties who would like to use FFX without its GUI.

/**
 * This class implements forces that are specific to Drude oscillators.  There are two distinct forces
 * it applies: an anisotropic harmonic force connecting each Drude particle to its parent particle; and
 * a screened Coulomb interaction between specific pairs of dipoles.  The latter is typically used between
 * closely bonded particles whose Coulomb interaction would otherwise be fully excluded.
 * <p>
 * To use this class, create a DrudeForce object, then call addParticle() once for each Drude particle in the
 * System to define its parameters.  After a particle has been added, you can modify its force field parameters
 * by calling setParticleParameters().  This will have no effect on Contexts that already exist unless you
 * call updateParametersInContext().  Likewise, call addScreenedPair() for each pair of dipoles (each dipole
 * consisting of a Drude particle and its parent) that should be computed.

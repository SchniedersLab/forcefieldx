 * The FileOpener interface specifies Runnable objects which can return one or

 * except by a class implementing PotentialsFunctions; one should pass that
 * class the File to be opened, which constructs an implementation of
 * FileOpener.
 * <p>
 * To some extent, this interface is legacy code of when I was trying to
 * implement the open() methods from MainPanel instead of openWait(); it should
 * be possible to simply wrap the methods into the classes implementing
 * PotentialsFunctions.

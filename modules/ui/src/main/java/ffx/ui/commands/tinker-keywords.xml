    <body>
        <section name="Output Control">
            <subsection name="ARCHIVE" rep="CHECKBOX">Causes TINKER molecular dynamics-based programs to write trajectories
                directly to a single plain-text archive file with the .arc format. If an archive file already
                exists at the start of the calculation, then the newly generated trajectory is appended to the
                end of the existing file. The default in the absence of this keyword is to write the trajectory
                snapshots to consecutively numbered cycle files.
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="DEBUG" rep="CHECKBOX">Turns on printing of detailed information and intermediate values throughout
                the progress of a TINKER computation; not recommended for use with large structures or
                full potential energy functions since a summary of every individual interaction will usually
                be output.
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="EXIT-PAUSE" rep="CHECKBOX">This keyword causes TINKER programs to pause and wait for a carriage
                return at the end of execution prior to returning control to the operating system. This is
                useful to keep the execution window open following termination on machines running
                Microsoft Windows or Apple MacOS. The default in the absence of the EXIT-PAUSE
                keyword, is to return control to the operating system immediately at program termination.
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="NOVERSION" rep="CHECKBOX">Turns off the use of version numbers appended to the end of filenames as
                the method for generating filenames for updated copies of an existing file. The presence of
                this keyword results in direct use of input file names without a search for the highest
                available version, and requires the entry of specific output file names in many additional
                cases. By default, in the absence of this keyword, TINKER generates and attaches version
                numbers in a manner similar to the Digital OpenVMS operating system. For example,
                subsequent new versions of the file molecule.xyz would be written first to the file
                molecule.xyz_2, then to molecule.xyz_3, etc.
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="OVERWRITE" rep="CHECKBOX">Causes TINKER programs, such as minimizations, that output
                intermediate coordinate sets to create a single disk file for the intermediate results which is
                successively overwritten with the new intermediate coordinates as they become available.
                This keyword is essentially the opposite of the SAVECYCLE keyword.
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="SAVE-CYCLE" rep="CHECKBOX">This keyword causes TINKER programs, such as minimizations, that
                output intermediate coordinate sets to save each successive set to the next consecutively
                numbered cycle file. The SAVE-CYCLE keyword is the opposite of the OVERWRITE
                keyword.
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="SAVE-FORCE" rep="CHECKBOX">This keyword causes TINKER molecular dynamics calculations to save the
                values of the force components on each atom to a separate cycle file. These files are written
                whenever the atomic coordinate snapshots are written during the dynamics run. Each atomic
                force file name contains as a suffix the cycle number followed by the letter f.
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="SAVE-INDUCED" rep="CHECKBOX">This keyword causes TINKER molecular dynamics calculations that
                involve polarizable atomic multipoles to save the values of the induced dipole components on
                each polarizable atom to a separate cycle file. These files are written whenever the atomic
                coordinate snapshots are written during the dynamics run. Each induced dipole file name
                contains as a suffix the cycle number followed by the letter u.
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="SAVE-VELOCITY" rep="CHECKBOX">This keyword causes TINKER molecular dynamics calculations to save
                the values of the velocity components on each atom to a separate cycle file. These files are
                written whenever the atomic coordinate snapshots are written during the dynamics run.
                Each velocity file name contains as a suffix the cycle number followed by the letter v.
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="VERBOSE" rep="CHECKBOX">Turns on printing of secondary and informational output during a variety of
                TINKER computations; a subset of the more extensive output provided by the DEBUG
                keyword.
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="DIGITS" rep="TEXTFIELD">[integer] This keyword controls the number of digits of precision output by
                TINKER in reporting potential energies and atomic coordinates. The allowed values for the
                integer modifier are 4, 6 and 8. Input values less than 4 will be set to 4, and those greater
                than 8 will be set to 8. Final energy values reported by most TINKER programs will contain
                the specified number of digits to the right of the decimal point. The number of decimal places
                to be output for atomic coordinates is generally two larger than the value of DIGITS. In the
                absence of the DIGITS keyword a default value of 4 is used, and energies will be reported to
                4 decimal places with coordinates to 6 decimal places.
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="PRINTOUT" rep="TEXTFIELD">[integer] A general parameter for iterative procedures such as
                minimizations that sets the number of iterations between writes of status information to the
                standard output. The default value in the absence of the keyword is 1, i.e., the calculation
                status is given every iteration.
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="WRITEOUT" rep="TEXTFIELD">[integer] A general parameter for iterative procedures such as
                minimizations that sets the number of iterations between writes of intermediate results
                (such as the current coordinates) to disk file(s). The default value in the absence of the
                keyword is 1, i.e., the intermediate results are written to file on every iteration. Whether
                successive results are saved to new files or replace previously written intermediate results is
                controlled by the OVERWRITE and SAVECYCLE keywords.
            </subsection>
        </section>
        <section name="Force Field Selection">
            <subsection name="FORCEFIELD" rep="TEXTFIELD">[name] This keyword provides a name for the force field to be used in the
                current calculation. Its value is usually set in the master force field parameter file for the
                calculation (see the PARAMETERS keyword) instead of in the keyfile.
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="PARAMETERS" rep="TEXTFIELD">[file name] Provides the name of the force field parameter file to be used
                for the current TINKER calculation. The standard file name extension for parameter files,
                .prm, is an optional part of the file name modifier. The default in the absence of the
                PARAMETERS keyword is to look for a parameter file with the same base name as the
                molecular system and ending in the .prm extension. If a valid parameter file is not found,
                the user will asked to provide a file name interactively.

                that can be used to restrain the angle between three atoms to lie within a specified angle range. The initial
                integer modifiers contains the atom numbers of the three atoms whose angle is to be restrained. The first
                real modifier is the force constant in kcal/degree2 for the restraint. The last two real number modifiers give
                the lower and upper bounds in degrees on the allowed angle values. If the angle lies between the lower and
                upper bounds, the restraint potential is zero. Outside the bounds, the harmonic restraint is applied. If the
                angle range modifiers are omitted, then the atoms are restrained to the angle found in the input structure. If
                the force constant is also omitted, a default value of 10.0 is used.

                give the lower and upper bounds in ??ngstroms on the allowed distance values. If the interatomic distance
                lies between the lower and upper bounds, the restraint potential is zero. Outside the bounds, the harmonic
                restraint is applied. If the distance range modifiers are omitted, then the atoms are restrained to the

                distance restraint between the centers-of-mass of two groups of atoms. The integer modifiers are the
                numbers of the two groups which must be defined separately via the GROUP keyword. The first real
                modifier is the force constant in kcal/??2 for the restraint. The last two real number modifiers give the lower
                and upper bounds in ??ngstroms on the allowed distance values. If the distance range modifiers are omitted,
                then the atoms are restrained to the intergroup distance found in the input structure. If the force constant is

                individual atom to a specified coordinate position. The initial integer modifier contains the atom number of
                the atom to be restrained. The first real modifier sets the force constant in kcal/??2 for the harmonic restraint
                potential. The next three real number modifiers give the X-, Y- and Z-coordinates to which the atom is
                tethered. The final real modifier defines a sphere around the specified coordinates within which the
                restraint value is zero. If all the real modifiers are omitted, then the atom is restrained to the origin. If the
                force constant is also omitted, a default value of 100.0 is used.

                computed in the atom order listed, is to be restrained. The first real modifier gives a force constant in
                kcal/degree2. The last two real number modifiers give the lower and upper bounds in degrees on the allowed
                torsional angle values. The angle values given can wrap around across -180 and +180 degrees. Outside the
                allowed angle range, the harmonic restraint is applied. If the angle range modifiers are omitted, then the
                atoms are restrained to the torsional angle found in the input structure. If the force constant is also omitted,

            <subsection name="SPHERE" rep="EDITCOMBOBOX">[4 reals, or 1 integer and 1 real] This keyword provides an alternative to the
                ACTIVE and INACTIVE keywords for specification of subsets of active atoms. If four real
                number modifiers are provided, the first three are taken as X-, Y- and Z-coordinates and the
                fourth is the radius of a sphere centered at these coordinates. In this case, all atoms within
                the sphere at the start of the calculation are active throughout the calculation, while all other
                atoms are inactive. Similarly if one integer and real number are given, an ??????active?????? sphere
                with radius set by the real is centered on the system atom with atom number given by the
                integer modifier. Multiple SPHERE keyword lines can be present in a single keyfile, and the
                list of active atoms specified by the spheres is cumulative.

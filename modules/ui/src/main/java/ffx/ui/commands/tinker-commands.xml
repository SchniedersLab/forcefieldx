 is provided mostly for demonstration purposes. For example, we use ALCHEMY in a
 molecular modeling course laboratory exercise to perform such classic mutations as chloride
 to bromide and ethane to methanol in water. The present version uses the perturbation
 formula and windowing with an explicit mapping of atoms involved in the mutation
 (‘‘AMBER’’-style), instead of thermodynamic integration and independent freely propagating
 groups of mutated atoms (‘‘CHARMM’’-style). Some of the code specific to this program is
 limited to the AMBER and OPLS potential functional forms, but could be easily generalized
 to handle other potentials. A more general and sophisticated version is currently under
 development."

 structures to an rms gradient of 1.0 to 0.1 kcal/mole/Å. It has a relatively fast cycle time and
 is tolerant of poor initial structures, but converges in a slow, linear fashion near the
 minimum. The user supplies the name of the TINKER .xyz coordinates file and a target rms
 gradient value at which the minimization will terminate. Output consists of minimization

 The default options are recommended unless the user is familiar with the math involved.
 This program operates in Cartesian coordinate space and is fairly tolerant of poor input
 structures. Typical algorithm iteration times are longer than with nonlinear conjugate
 gradient or variable metric methods, but many fewer iterations are required for complete
 minimization. NEWTON is usually the best choice for minimizations to the 0.01 to 0.000001
 kcal/mole/Å level of rms gradient convergence. Tests for directions of negative curvature can
 be removed, allowing NEWTON to be used for optimization to conformational transition
 state structures (this only works if the starting point is very close to the transition state).
 Input consists of a TINKER .xyz coordinates file; output is an updated set of minimized
 coordinates and minimization statistics."

 The method does not perform line searches, but requires computation of energies and

 operates on Cartesian coordinates from a TINKER .xyz file. OPTIMIZE will typically
 converge somewhat faster and more completely than MINIMIZE. However, the need to store
 and manipulate a full inverse Hessian estimate limits its use to structures containing less
 than a few hundred atoms on workstation class machines. As with the other minimizers,
 OPTIMIZE needs input coordinates and an rms gradient cutoff criterion. The output
 coordinates are saved in updated .xyz files or as cycle files."

/**
 * Class Random is the abstract base class for a pseudorandom number generator
 * (PRNG) designed for use in parallel scientific programming. It differs from
 * class java.util.Random in the following ways:
 * <UL>
 * <LI>
 * Instances can be created by calling a static factory method. The factory
 * method can take the name of a subclass as an argument and return an instance
 * of that subclass of class Random. This makes it easier to write a program
 * that can substitute a different PRNG algorithm at run time. Class {@linkplain
 * DefaultRandom} provides a default PRNG algorithm.
 * <BR>&nbsp;
 * <LI>
 * Whereas class java.util.Random generates 48-bit numbers under the hood, class
 * Random generates 64-bit numbers. This makes class Random faster than class
 * java.util.Random for some operations, notably the <code>nextDouble()</code>
 * method.
 * <BR>&nbsp;
 * <LI>
 * Whereas the PRNG algorithm in class java.util.Random has a period of about
 * 2<SUP>48</SUP>, the default PRNG algorithm in class {@linkplain
 * DefaultRandom} has a period of about 2<SUP>64</SUP>. This lets a parallel
 * program scale up to larger problem sizes without exhausting the PRNG's
 * period.
 * <BR>&nbsp;
 * <LI>
 * To support the <I>leapfrogging</I> and <I>sequence splitting</I> techniques
 * for generating pseudorandom numbers in multiple parallel threads or
 * processes, class Random includes methods for skipping ahead in the sequence
 * of generated numbers, without having to generate all the intermediate
 * numbers.
 * <BR>&nbsp;
 * <LI>
 * To avoid unnecessary thread synchronization overhead, class Random is not
 * multiple thread safe. It assumes that the surrounding program ensures that
 * only one thread at a time calls methods on an instance.
 * </UL>
 * <P>
 * Each method for generating a number comes in two versions; for example:
 * <PRE>
 *     public double nextDouble();
 *     public double nextDouble (long skip);
 * </PRE> Calling the second version with an argument <code>skip</code> is
 * equivalent to calling the first version <code>skip</code> times:
 * <PRE>
 *     Random prng1 = Random.getInstance (1234L);
 *     double x = prng1.nextDouble (1000);
 *     Random prng2 = Random.getInstance (1234L);
 *     double y;
 *     for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; ++ i)
 *         y = prng2.nextDouble();
 * </PRE> At the end of the above code fragment, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> will
 * have the same value. However, calling <code>nextDouble(1000)</code> will
 * typically be much faster than calling <code>nextDouble()</code> 1000 times.
 * Conversely,
 * <code>nextDouble(1)</code> is equivalent to <code>nextDouble()</code>, but the former
 * will typically be slower than the latter.
 * <P>
 * An instance of class Random can be serialized; for example, to checkpoint the
 * state of the PRNG into a file and restore its state later.
 * <P>
 * The design of class Random is inspired in part by Coddington's JAPARA
 * library. For further information, see P. Coddington and A. Newell, JAPARA --
 * A Java random number generator library for high-performance computing, in
 * <I>Proceedings of the 18th IEEE International Parallel and Distributed
 * Processing Symposium (IPDPS'04),</I> April 26-30, 2004, page 156.

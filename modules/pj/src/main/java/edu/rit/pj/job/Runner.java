/**
 * Class Runner is a parallel program that runs, in parallel, a group of
 * {@linkplain Job}s created by a {@linkplain JobGenerator}. The job generator
 * is specified on the command line as a constructor expression. An instance of
 * the class specified in the constructor expression is constructed, with the
 * constructor arguments specified in the constructor expression. For further
 * information, see class {@linkplain edu.rit.util.Instance Instance}.
 * <P>
 * The Runner program is targeted at three use cases:
 * <UL>
 *
 * <LI>
 * <B>Sequential jobs on a cluster parallel computer.</B> Each job is a
 * sequential (single-threaded) program. The Runner program is running on a
 * cluster parallel computer with <I>N</I> nodes and one CPU per node. Run the
 * Runner program as follows:
 * <PRE>
 *     java -Dpj.nn=<I>N</I> edu.rit.pj.job.Runner . . .
 * </PRE> The Runner program runs with one process per node and one thread per
 * process.
 *
 * <LI>
 * <B>Sequential jobs on a hybrid parallel computer.</B> Each job is a
 * sequential (single-threaded) program. The Runner program is running on a
 * hybrid SMP cluster parallel computer with <I>N</I> nodes and <I>C</I> total
 * CPUs. (For example, on a hybrid parallel computer with 10 nodes and 4 CPUs
 * per node, <I>C</I> = 40.) Run the Runner program as follows:
 * <PRE>
 *     java -Dpj.nn=<I>N</I> -Dpj.np=<I>C</I> edu.rit.pj.job.Runner . . .
 * </PRE> The Runner program runs with multiple processes per node and one
 * thread per process.
 *
 * <LI>
 * <B>SMP parallel jobs on a hybrid parallel computer.</B> Each job is an SMP
 * parallel (multi-threaded) program. The Runner program is running on a hybrid
 * SMP cluster parallel computer with <I>N</I> nodes and multiple CPUs per node.
 * Run the Runner program as follows:
 * <PRE>
 *     java -Dpj.nn=<I>N</I> edu.rit.pj.job.Runner . . .
 * </PRE> The Runner program runs with one process per node and multiple threads
 * per process, typically as many threads as there are CPUs on the node.
 * </UL>
 * <P>
 * All these processes form a <I>worker team.</I> The Runner program uses the
 * job generator specified on the command line to create jobs and sends each job
 * to a worker team process to be executed.
 * <P>
 * When the Runner program starts, it prints the job generator constructor
 * expression on the standard output. Whenever a job starts or finishes, the
 * Runner program prints a log message on the standard output consisting of the
 * job's number and description.
 * <P>
 * <B>Checkpointing.</B> It is recommended to redirect the Runner program's
 * standard output into a <I>checkpoint file.</I> If a failure occurs before the
 * Runner program finishes running all the jobs, the checkpoint file contains a
 * record of the job generator that was used as well as which jobs did and did
 * not finish. To resume the Runner program where it left off, specify the
 * checkpoint file name on the command line instead of a job generator
 * constructor expression. The Runner program reads the checkpoint file to
 * determine the job generator and the jobs that finished. The Runner program
 * then generates and runs the jobs that did not finish.
 * <P>
 * Usage: java edu.rit.pj.job.Runner { <I>generator</I> | <I>file</I> }
 * <BR><I>generator</I> = Job generator constructor expression
 * <BR><I>file</I> = Checkpoint file name

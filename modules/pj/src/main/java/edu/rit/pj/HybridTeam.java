/**
 * Class HybridTeam provides a team of threads, distributed across the processes
 * of a cluster parallel program, for executing a {@linkplain WorkerRegion} in
 * parallel.
 * <P>
 * A hybrid team uses a communicator for message passing. The communicator is
 * specified as a constructor argument; if not specified, the world communicator
 * is used. Every process that is part of the communicator must create the
 * hybrid team. In class HybridTeam, there are one or more worker threads per
 * process; typically, the number of threads in each process equals the number
 * of CPUs on the node executing the process. (To get just one worker thread per
 * process, use class {@linkplain WorkerTeam}.) Every worker thread in every
 * process has a unique index, going from index 0 for the first thread in the
 * first process to index <I>K</I>&minus;1 for the last thread in the last
 * process, where <I>K</I> is the total number of worker threads in all the
 * processes. In process rank 0, there is an additional master thread.
 * <P>
 * When a hybrid team is constructed, the processes in the communicator send
 * messages amongst themselves to make every process aware of the number of
 * worker threads in each process. These messages use a tag of
 * <code>Integer.MIN_VALUE</code>. If an I/O error occurs during this message
 * passing, the constructor throws an IOException.
 * <P>
 * To execute a worker region, create a HybridTeam object; create an instance of
 * a concrete subclass of class {@linkplain WorkerRegion}; and pass this
 * instance to the hybrid team's <code>execute()</code> method. For further
 * information, see class {@linkplain WorkerRegion}.

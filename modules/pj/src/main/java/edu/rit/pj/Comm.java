/**
 * Class Comm provides a communicator for a PJ cluster parallel program. Class
 * Comm provides a method to initialize the PJ message passing middleware and
 * run the parallel program on multiple processors of a cluster parallel
 * computer. Class Comm also provides methods for passing messages between the
 * processes of the parallel program.
 * <HR>
 * <p>
 * <B>BASIC CONCEPTS</B>
 * <p>
 * A <B>cluster parallel computer</B> typically consists of a <B>frontend
 * processor</B> and a number of <B>backend processors</B> connected via a
 * dedicated high-speed network. A user logs into the frontend processor and
 * runs a PJ program there. The PJ message passing middleware causes copies of
 * the PJ program to run in a number of separate processes, each process on a
 * different backend processor. The backend processes run the PJ program, using
 * the PJ middleware to send messages amongst themselves. The PJ middleware
 * redirects the backend processes' standard output and standard error streams
 * to the frontend process. The frontend process does not actually execute the
 * PJ program, but merely displays all the backend processes' standard output
 * and standard error streams on the frontend process's own standard output and
 * standard error.
 * <p>
 * For the PJ message passing middleware to work, certain server processes must
 * be running. See package {@linkplain edu.rit.pj.cluster} for further
 * informati
 * on.
 * <p>
 * To initialize the PJ message passing middleware, the program must first call
 * the static <code>Comm.init()</code> method, passing in the command line
 * arguments.
 * <p>
 * A <B>communicator</B> is associated with a group of backend processes. The
 * communicator's <B>size</B> is the number of processes in the group. Each
 * process in the communicator has a different <B>rank</B> in the range 0 ..
 * <I>size</I>-1. A process may obtain the size and rank by calling the
 * communicator's <code>size()</code> and <code>rank()</code> methods.
 * <p>
 * There is one predefined communicator, the <B>world communicator,</B>
 * consisting of all the backend processes in the parallel program. A process
 * may obtain a reference to the world communicator by calling the static
 * <code>Comm.world()</code> method. Typically, the first few lines in a PJ cluster
 * parallel program look like this:
 * <PRE>
 * public class AParallelProgram
 * {
 * public static void main
 * (String[] args)
 * throws Exception
 * {
 * Comm.init (args);
 * Comm world = Comm.world();
 * int size = world.size();
 * int rank = world.rank();
 * . . .</PRE>
 * <p>
 * The number of processes in the parallel program -- that is, the size of the
 * world communicator -- is specified by the <code>"pj.np"</code> property, which
 * must be an integer greater than or equal to 1. You can specify the number of
 * processes on the Java command line like this:
 * <PRE>
 * java -Dpj.np=4 . . .</PRE>
 * <p>
 * If the <code>"pj.np"</code> property is not specified, the default is 1.
 * <p>
 * The PJ program will run on the specified number of backend processors as
 * described above. To determine which backend processors to use, the PJ program
 * interacts with a <B>Job Scheduler</B> server process running on the frontend
 * processor. When the PJ program starts and calls the <code>Comm.init()</code>
 * method, the middleware first prints the job number on the standard error. The
 * middleware then waits until the required number of backend processors are
 * ready to run a job. As each backend processor becomes ready, the middleware
 * prints on the standard error the name of each backend processor assigned to
 * the job. Once all are ready, the PJ program starts running on those backend
 * processors, and all further output comes from the PJ program. Since each PJ
 * program interacts with the Job Scheduler, the Job Scheduler can ensure that
 * each backend processor is running a backend process for only one job at a
 * time.
 * <p>
 * Depending on the system load, your PJ program may have to wait in the Job
 * Scheduler's queue for a while until enough backend processors become ready.
 * If you get tired of waiting, you can kill your PJ program (e.g., by typing
 * CTRL-C), which will remove your PJ program from the Job Scheduler's queue.
 * <p>
 * The Job Scheduler has a web interface that lets you examine the cluster
 * status. Just point your web browser at this URL:
 *
 * <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;http://&lt;hostname&gt;:8080/</code>
 * <p>
 * where <code>&lt;hostname&gt;</code> is replaced by the host name of the frontend
 * processor. The default port for the cluster status web interface is port
 * 8080. The Job Scheduler can be configured to use a different port. For
 * further information, see package {@linkplain edu.rit.pj.cluster}.
 * <p>
 * If the PJ program is executed on a host where no Job Scheduler is running,
 * the PJ program will run in <I>one</I> process on that host (i.e., the machine
 * you're logged into), rather than on the backend processors. The message
 * passing methods in class Comm will still work, though. This option can be
 * useful for debugging a PJ program's logic on a non-parallel machine before
 * running the PJ program on a cluster.
 * <HR>
 * <p>
 * <B>MESSAGE PASSING</B>
 * <p>
 * PJ provides two categories of communication, <B>point-to-point
 * communication</B> and <B>collective communication.</B> The following methods
 * of class Comm are used for point-to-point communication:
 * <UL>
 * <LI><code>send()</code>
 * <LI><code>receive()</code>
 * <LI><code>sendReceive()</code>
 * <LI><code>floodSend()</code>
 * <LI><code>floodReceive()</code>
 * </UL>
 * The following methods are used for collective communication:
 * <UL>
 * <LI><code>broadcast()</code>
 * <LI><code>scatter()</code>
 * <LI><code>gather()</code>
 * <LI><code>allGather()</code>
 * <LI><code>reduce()</code>
 * <LI><code>allReduce()</code>
 * <LI><code>allToAll()</code>
 * <LI><code>scan()</code>
 * <LI><code>exclusiveScan()</code>
 * <LI><code>barrier()</code>
 * </UL>
 * These methods are described further in the sections below.
 * <p>
 * In addition, you can create a new communicator consisting of all, or a subset
 * of, the processes in an existing communicator. Message passing in the new
 * communicator is completely independent of message passing in the original
 * communicator. The following method creates a new communicator:
 * <UL>
 * <LI><code>createComm()</code>
 * </UL>
 * <HR>
 * <p>
 * <B>POINT-TO-POINT COMMUNICATION</B>
 * <p>
 * One process in a PJ cluster parallel program, the <B>source process</B>, may
 * use a communicator to send a message to another process in the program, the
 * <B>destination process</B>. This is called a <B>point-to-point
 * communication</B> because just the two processes are involved (as opposed to
 * a collective communication, which involves all the processes). Five
 * point-to-point communication methods are available in this release: send,
 * receive, send-receive, flood-send, and flood-receive.
 * <p>
 * <B>Send and Receive</B>
 * <p>
 * To do a point-to-point communication, the source process calls the
 * <code>send()</code> method on a certain communicator, such as the world
 * communicator. The source process specifies the destination process's rank,
 * the <B>tag</B> for the message, and a <B>buffer</B> containing the data items
 * to be sent (type {@linkplain edu.rit.mp.Buf}). Likewise, the destination
 * process calls the <code>receive()</code> method on the same communicator as the
 * source process. The destination process specifies the source process's rank,
 * the message tag which must be the same as in the source process, and the
 * buffer for the data items to be received.
 * <p>
 * A <code>send()</code> method call and a <code>receive()</code> method call are said
 * to <B>match</B> if (a) the rank passed to the <code>send()</code> method equals
 * the rank of the process calling <code>receive()</code>, (b) the rank passed to
 * the <code>receive()</code> method equals the rank of the process calling
 * <code>send()</code>, (c) the item data type in the source buffer is the same as
 * the item data type in the destination buffer, and (d) the send message tag
 * equals the receive message tag. A <code>receive()</code> method call will block
 * until a matching <code>send()</code> method call occurs. If more than one
 * <code>send()</code> method call matches a <code>receive()</code> method call, one of
 * the matching <code>send()</code> method calls is picked in an unspecified manner.
 * A <code>send()</code> method call <I>may</I> block until a matching
 * <code>receive()</code> method call occurs due to flow control in the underlying
 * network communication.
 * <p>
 * The message tag can be used to distinguish different kinds of messages. A
 * <code>receive()</code> method call will only match a <code>send()</code> method call
 * with the same tag. If there is no need to distinguish different kinds of
 * messages, omit the tag (it will default to 0).
 * <p>
 * Once a <code>send()</code> method call and a <code>receive()</code> method call have
 * been matched together, the actual message data transfer takes place. Each
 * item in the source buffer, starting at index 0 and continuing for the entire
 * length of the source buffer, is written to the message. At the other end,
 * each item in the destination buffer, starting at index 0, is read from the
 * message.
 * <p>
 * The <code>receive()</code> method returns a {@linkplain CommStatus} object. The
 * status object gives the actual rank of the process that sent the message, the
 * actual message tag that was received, and the actual number of data items in
 * the message. If the actual number of data items in the message is less than
 * the length of the destination buffer, nothing is stored into the extra data
 * items at the end of the destination buffer. If the actual number of data
 * items in the message is greater than the length of the destination buffer,
 * the extra data items at the end of the message are discarded.
 * <p>
 * The <code>send()</code> method does not return until all the message elements
 * have been written from the source buffer. Likewise, the <code>receive()</code>
 * method does not return until all the message elements have been read into the
 * destination buffer. However, you cannot assume that because the
 * <code>send()</code> method has returned, the matching <code>receive()</code> method
 * has also returned. Because of buffering in the underlying network
 * communication, not all the destination items might have been received even
 * though all the source items have been sent.
 * <p>
 * The destination process, instead of specifying a particular source process,
 * can declare that it will receive a message from any source process by
 * specifying null for the source process rank in the <code>receive()</code> method
 * call. This is called a <B>wildcard source</B>. In this case the
 * <code>receive()</code> method call's returned status object will indicate the
 * actual source process that sent the message.
 * <p>
 * The destination process, instead of specifying a particular message tag, can
 * declare that it will receive a message with any tag by specifying null for
 * the tag in the <code>receive()</code> method call. This is called a <B>wildcard
 * tag</B>. Alternatively, the destination process can specify a range of
 * message tags, and it will receive a message with any tag in the given range.
 * In these cases the <code>receive()</code> method call's returned status object
 * will indicate the actual message tag that was sent.
 * <p>
 * A process can send a message to itself. In this case one thread must call
 * <code>send()</code> (specifying the process's own rank as the destination) and a
 * different thread must call <code>receive()</code> (specifying the process's own
 * rank as the source), otherwise a deadlock will ensue.
 * <p>
 * <B>Send-Receive</B>
 * <p>
 * By calling the <code>sendReceive()</code> method, a process can send a buffer of
 * outgoing message items to a destination process while simultaneously
 * receiving a buffer of incoming message items from a source process. The
 * destination process may be the same as the source process, or different from
 * the source process. The outgoing message items must come from a different
 * place than where the incoming message items will be stored, otherwise the
 * incoming message items may overwrite the outgoing message items before they
 * can be sent. When the <code>sendReceive()</code> method returns, the outgoing
 * message items have been fully sent, but they may not yet have been fully
 * received; and the incoming message items have been fully received.
 * <p>
 * With the <code>sendReceive()</code> method, a process cannot receive a message
 * from a wildcard source, and a process cannot receive a message with a
 * wildcard tag or a range of tags. The process calling <code>sendReceive()</code>
 * must know the rank of the source process and the message tag (if not 0). The
 * <code>sendReceive()</code> method does return a status object giving the outcome
 * of the receive half of the send-receive operation, just as the
 * <code>receive()</code> method does.
 * <p>
 * A process can send-receive messages with itself. In this case one thread must
 * call <code>sendReceive()</code> (specifying the process's own rank as the source
 * and destination) and a different thread must also call <code>sendReceive()</code>
 * (specifying the process's own rank as the source and destination), otherwise
 * a deadlock will ensue.
 * <p>
 * <B>Non-Blocking Communication</B>
 * <p>
 * The <code>send()</code>, <code>receive()</code>, and <code>sendReceive()</code> methods
 * each have a non-blocking version. A non-blocking communication method
 * initiates the communication operation and immediately returns, storing the
 * state of the communication operation in a {@linkplain CommRequest} object.
 * The communicator then performs the communication operation in a separate
 * thread. This allows the calling thread to do other work while the
 * communication operation is in progress. To wait for the send and receive
 * operations to finish, call the CommRequest object's <code>waitForFinish()</code>
 * method.
 * <p>
 * <B>Flood-Send and Flood-Receive</B>
 * <p>
 * Any process can send a message to all processes in the communicator. This is
 * called "flooding" the message. First, all processes must start a
 * flood-receive operation, either by calling the non-blocking
 * <code>floodReceive()</code> method, or by having a separate thread call the
 * blocking <code>floodReceive()</code> method. Then, one process (any process) must
 * call the <code>floodSend()</code> method. The data items in the flood-send
 * operation's outgoing buffer are copied into the flood-receive operation's
 * incoming buffer in all processes.
 * <p>
 * Message flooding is similar to the "broadcast" collective communication
 * operation (see below). The differences are these: Broadcasting combines
 * sending and receiving in a single operation; flooding uses separate send and
 * receive operations. For broadcasting, every process must know which process
 * is sending the outgoing data items; for flooding, the receiving processes do
 * not need to know which process is sending (any process can send).
 * <HR>
 * <p>
 * <B>COLLECTIVE COMMUNICATION</B>
 * <p>
 * A PJ cluster parallel program may use a communicator to send a message among
 * all the processes in the program at the same time. This is called a
 * <B>collective communication</B> because all the processes in the communicator
 * are involved (as opposed to a point-to-point communication). Ten collective
 * communication methods are available in this release: broadcast, scatter,
 * gather, all-gather, reduce, all-reduce, all-to-all, scan, exclusive-scan, and
 * barrier. Further collective communication methods will be added to class Comm
 * in a later release.
 * <p>
 * <B>Broadcast</B>
 * <p>
 * One process in the communicator, the <B>root</B> process, has a source buffer
 * (type {@linkplain edu.rit.mp.Buf Buf}) filled with data. The other processes
 * in the communicator each have a destination buffer with the same length and
 * the same item data type as the source buffer. Each process calls the
 * communicator's <code>broadcast()</code> method. Afterwards, all the destination
 * buffers contain the same data as the source buffer.

 * Reduce is like gather, except the buffers' contents are combined together

 * communicator's <code>reduce()</code> method, specifying some binary operation
 * (type {@linkplain edu.rit.pj.reduction.Op Op}) for combining the data.
 * Afterwards, each element of the buffer in the root process contains the
 * result of combining all the corresponding elements in all the buffers using
 * the specified binary operation. For example, if the operation is addition,
 * each buffer element in the root process ends up being the sum of the
 * corresponding buffer elements in all the processes. In the non-root
 * processes, the buffers' contents may be changed from their original contents.

/**
 * The Complex FFT supports interleaved or blocked data.
 * <p>
 * For interleaved data, the complex data is stored in the following way:
 * <PRE>
 * Re(d[i]) = data[offset + stride*i]
 * Im(d[i]) = data[offset + stride*i + 1]
 * </PRE>
 * <p>
 * For blocked data, the complex data is stored in the following way:
 * <PRE>
 * Re(d[i]) = data[offset + stride*i]
 * Im(d[i]) = data[offset + stride*i + im]
 * where the offset to the imaginary part is specified by the im parameter.
 * For BLOCKED_X, im = nX.
 * For BLOCKED_XY, im = nX*nY.
 * For BLOCKED_XYZ, im = nX*nY*nZ.
 * </PRE>

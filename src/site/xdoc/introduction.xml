                because the syntax is convenient for refactoring between command scripts and the core Java libraries.
                The Groovy commands are compiled ahead of time into Java bytecode for syntax checking, better
                performance and for unit testing.
                Groovy commands are also available from the "groovy" directory for custom modification. Modified
                scripts or new commands can be evaluated using the "ffx" or "ffxc" start-up commands for execution.

                The core libraries are written in Java, which is being explored as an alternative to traditional
                CPU languages (e.g., C, C++ and Fortran). With the introduction of a unified
                "single instruction multiple data" (SIMD) API for either AVX instructions on x64 or NEON instructions on
                AArch64, the JVM is increasingly competitive with natively compiled languages for performance on CPUs.

                Kotlin is an emerging language from JetBrains that is interoperable with Java. You can use Kotlin to
                control FFX from within a Jupyter Notebook, including convenient support directly within the IntelliJ
                IDE. The "Lets-Plot" Kotlin <a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/lets-plot-kotlin">library</a> is especially
                interesting.

                Python is a popular language for scientific computing, which is now supported in by an embedded
                <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/python/">Python v. 3.10 engine.</a>
                Example Python scripts can be found in the "python" directory.
                Just like for Groovy, you can send Python scripts to the "ffx" or "ffxc" start-up commands for execution.

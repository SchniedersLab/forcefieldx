        <p>The Force Field X project is hosted at
          <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/SchniedersLab/forcefieldx">Github</a>.
        </p>
        <p>To clone the Force Field X source using GIT:</p>
        <source>git clone https://github.com/SchniedersLab/forcefieldx.git ffx</source>
        <p>In the future, your clone of Force Field X can be updated to the latest version using the command:</p>
        <source>git pull origin master</source>

      <subsection name="Build Using Maven">
        <p>A Maven project file (pom.xml) is provided to build Force Field X on any platform. After cloing the Force
          Field X git repository, change directories into the base project directory. Then execute:
        </p>
        <source>mvn</source>
        <p>This requires Maven v. 3.8 or later to be installed with its bin directory included in your $PATH environment
          variable. The first time this command is executed, Maven will download build dependencies and Force Field X
          runtime
          dependencies. Future executions are quicker. Force Field X will self-test its modules and report failures.
          Only code that passes all testing should be pushed to the GitHub repository, so if any test fails it may be
          due to a local configuration issue. To execute the tests:
        </p>
        <source>mvn -DskipTests=false</source>
        <p>Once the Maven build succeeds, Force Field X can be executed using platform dependent start-up scripts
          located in the bin.
          On Mac OS X or Linux:
        </p>
        <source>bin/ffxc energy examples/alamet.xyz</source>
        <p>On Windows:</p>
        <source>bin/ffxc.bat energy examples/alamet.xyz</source>
        <p>The ffx/bin directory should be appended to your $PATH environment variable.
          The "energy" command refers to an internal version of the energy.ffx script that can be found in the
          ffx/scripts directory.

          <p>Maven is like "make", but more powerful due to the platform independence of the Jave Runtime Environment.
              Maven is used to manage the dependencies of Force Field X, compile it, test it, document it and
              then put everything together into the website.
              The Force Field X web site facilitates technology transfer and further development of features. Available documentation includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
              <li>Application Programming Interface (API) documentation for Force Field X packages is available as
                  <a href="apidocs/index.html">Javadocs.</a>
              </li>
              <li>Force Field X source code is available

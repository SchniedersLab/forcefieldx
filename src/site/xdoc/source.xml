                </p>
                <p>To clone the Force Field X source using GIT:</p>
                <source>git clone git@github.com:mjschnie/ffx.git ffx</source>
                <p>In the future, your clone of Force Field X can be updated to the latest version using the command:</p>
                <source>git pull origin master</source>

            <subsection name="Build Using Maven">
                <p>A Maven project file (pom.xml) is provided to build Force Field X on any platform. After cloing the Force Field X git repository, change
                    directoies into the base project directory. Then execute:
                </p>
                <source>mvn</source>
                <p>This requires Maven v. 3.2 or later to be installed with its bin directory included in your $PATH environment variable.
                    The first time this command is executed, Maven will download build dependencies and Force Field X runtime dependecies.
                    Future executions are quicker. Force Field X will self-test its modules and report failures.
                    Only code that passes all testing should be pushed to the GitHub repository, so if any test fails it may be
                    due to a local configuration issue. To execute the tests:
                </p>
                <source>mvn -DskipTests=false</source>
                <p>Once the Maven build succeeds, Force Field X can be executed using platform dependent start-up scripts located in the bin.
                    On Mac OS X or Linux:</p>
                <source>bin/ffxc energy examples/alamet.xyz</source>
                <p>On Windows:</p>
                <source>bin/ffxc.bat energy examples/alamet.xyz</source>
                <p>The ffx/bin directory should be appended to your $PATH environment variable.
                    The "energy" command refers to an internal version of the energy.ffx script that can be found in the ffx/scripts directory.
                    To embed your own script within FFX, place it into the scripts directory and rebuild FFX.

                <p>Maven is like "make", but more powerful due to the platform independence of the Jave Runtime Environment.
                    Maven is used to manage the dependencies of Force Field X, compile it, test it, document it and
                    then put everything together into the website.
                    The Force Field X web site facilitates technology transfer and further development of features. Available documentation includes:

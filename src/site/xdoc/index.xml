            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>Force Field X is an atomic resolution molecular modeling application that targets open research questions
              in the areas of:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>predicting the structure, thermodynamic stability and solubility of organic polymer crystals,
              </li>
              <li>predicting the effect of missense mutations on protein structure, thermodynamics and molecular
                phenotype
              </li>
              <li>computational design of biomolecules in both soluble and crystalline environments</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>New Approaches Developed in the Schnieders' Lab</h4>
            <p>To address these questions, novel global optimization methods and alchemical thermodynamic paths have
              been implemented in Force Field X. Examples include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Organic crystals property prediction based on "Growth of the Asymmetric Unit into a Crystal via
                alcHEmy" (GAUCHE)
              </li>
              <li>Many-body dead-end elimination (MB-DEE) for global optimization of non-pairwise energy functions over
                a discrete permutation space (i.e. side-chain rotamers). This algorithm is accelerated across one or
                more GPUs using MPI and OpenMM.
              </li>
              <li>A general "dual force field" framework to compute the thermodynamic cost to change between a fixed
                charge force field (e.g. OPLS-AA or Amber) and the polarizable multipole AMOEBA force field. This
                approach has been extended to explore computing the coarsen and refine legs of the indirect free energy
                path simultaneously (i.e. "Simultaneous Bookending"), which helps the method scale to protein sized
                systems.
              </li>
              <li>Refinement of biomolecular structures against experimental data sets (i.e. X-ray / neutron diffraction
                and/or CryoEM) and the polarizable AMOEBA force field.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The Force Field X Code and Manual</h4>
            <p>
              The FFX code is parallelized for clusters of many-core nodes using an open (GPL v. 3),
              modular and platform independent approach. See the FFX online manual for instructions on how
              to
              <a href="download.html">download</a>
              and
              <a href="install.html">install</a>
              the program.
              The manual also describes available
              <a href="commands.html">modeling commands</a>
              and
              <a href="properties.html">property settings</a>,
              and provides a few <a href="examples.html">examples</a> with more on the way.

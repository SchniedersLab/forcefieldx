              Assessing Variants of Uncertain Significance Implicated in Hearing Loss
              Using a Comprehensive Deafness Proteome
              <i>Submitted</i>

          <answer>
            <p>
                Hearing loss is the leading sensory deficit, affecting ~5% of the population.
                It exhibits remarkable heterogeneity across 223 genes with 6,328 pathogenic missense
                variants, making deafness-specific expertise a prerequisite for ascribing phenotypic
                consequences to genetic variants. Deafness-implicated variants are curated in the
                Deafness Variation Database (DVD) after classification by a genetic hearing loss
                expert panel and thorough informatics pipeline. However, seventy percent of the
                128,167 missense variants in the DVD are “variants of uncertain significance” (VUS)
                due to insufficient evidence for classification. Here, we use the deep learning protein
                prediction algorithm, AlphaFold2, to curate structures for all DVD genes. We refine these
                structures with global optimization and the AMOEBA force field and use DDGun3D to
                predict folding free energy differences (∆∆GFold) for all DVD missense variants.
                We find that 5,772 VUSs have a large, destabilizing ∆∆GFold that is consistent
                with pathogenic variants. When also filtered for CADD scores (>25.7), we determine
                3,456 VUSs are likely pathogenic at a probability of 99.0%. These VUSs affect
                119 patients (~3% of cases) sequenced by the OtoSCOPE targeted panel. Approximately
                half of these patients previously received an inconclusive report, and reclassification
                of these VUSs as pathogenic provides a new genetic diagnosis for six patients.

            <answer>
                <p>
                    During in silico crystal structure prediction of organic molecules, millions of
                    candidate structures are often generated. These candidates must be compared to
                    remove duplicates prior to further analysis (e.g. optimization with electronic
                    structure methods) and ultimately compared with structures determined
                    experimentally. The agreement of predicted and experimental structures forms the
                    basis of evaluating the results from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre
                    (CCDC) blind assessment of crystal structure prediction, which further motivates
                    the pursuit of rigorous alignments. Evaluating crystal structure packings
                    using coordinate root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) for N molecules (or N
                    asymmetric units) in a reproducible manner requires metrics to describe the
                    shape of the compared molecular clusters to account for alternative approaches
                    used to prioritize selection of molecules. Described here is a flexible
                    algorithm called Progressive Alignment of Crystals (PAC) to evaluate crystal
                    packing similarity using coordinate RMSD and introducing the radius of gyration
                    (Rg) as a metric to quantify the shape of the superimposed clusters. It is shown
                    that the absence of metrics to describe cluster shape adds ambiguity to the
                    results of the CCDC blind assessments because it is not possible to determine
                    whether the superposition algorithm has prioritized tightly packed molecular
                    clusters (i.e. to minimize Rg) or prioritized reduced RMSD (i.e. via possibly
                    elongated clusters with relatively larger Rg). For example, it is shown that
                    when the PAC algorithm described here uses single linkage to prioritize
                    molecules for inclusion in the superimposed clusters, the results are nearly
                    identical to those calculated by the widely used program COMPACK. However, the
                    lower Rg values obtained by the use of average linkage are favored for molecule
                    prioritization because the resulting RMSDs more equally reflect the importance
                    of packing along each dimension. It is shown that the PAC algorithm is faster
                    than COMPACK when using a single process and its utility for biomolecular
                    crystals is demonstrated. Finally, parallel scaling up to 64 processes in the
                    open-source code Force Field X is presented.

                    The transformation of a pharmaceutical solid from an anhydrous crystal
                    into a hydrated form during drug development represents a risk to a product’s
                    safety and efficacy due to the potential impact on stability, bioavailability,
                    and manufacturability. In this work, we examine 10 classical free energy
                    simulation protocols to evaluate the thermodynamic stability of hydrated
                    crystals relative to their anhydrous forms. Molecular dynamics simulations
                    are used to compute the Gibbs free energies of the crystals of three
                    pharmaceutically relevant systems using two fixed-charge potentials,
                    GAFF and OPLS, as well as the polarizable AMOEBA model. In addition, we
                    explore a variety of water models, including TIP3P, TIP4P, and AMOEBA, for
                    both the interstitial water and the effects of ambient humidity. The AMOEBA
                    model predicts free energy values most consistent with experimental measurements
                    among the models examined. The benefits of a fully polarizable water model
                    relative to fixed-charged models appear to derive predominantly from a better
                    treatment of water’s dipole moment in the crystalline phase. Despite this
                    improved physical treatment, we find that no single model produces reliable
                    predictions of the phase boundary between hydrated and anhydrous crystals from
                    theory alone. However, we show that accurate phase diagrams can be constructed
                    from the simulations by introducing a single experimentally determined
                    coexistence point. With this single experimental data point as input,
                    the phase boundary is correctly predicted within 10% relative humidity on the
                    temperature range of 15 to 75 °C for all three systems examined. Furthermore,
                    we demonstrate that with this known coexistence point as an input, the differences
                    between the various potentials and the water models become insignificant, as all
                    models yield accurate phase boundaries regardless of whether polarization is
                    included due to significant temperature-dependent error cancellation between models.

            Computational protein design, ab initio protein/RNA folding, and protein–ligand screening
            can be too computationally demanding for explicit treatment of solvent. For these applications,
            implicit solvent offers a compelling alternative, which we describe here for the polarizable
            atomic multipole AMOEBA force field based on three treatments of continuum electrostatics:
            numerical solutions to the nonlinear and linearized versions of the Poisson–Boltzmann equation (PBE),
            the domain-decomposition conductor-like screening model (ddCOSMO) approximation to the PBE,
            and the analytic generalized Kirkwood (GK) approximation. The continuum electrostatics models are
            combined with a nonpolar estimator based on novel cavitation and dispersion terms. Electrostatic
            model parameters are numerically optimized using a least-squares style target function based on a
            library of 103 small-molecule solvation free energy differences. Mean signed errors for the adaptive
            Poisson–Boltzmann solver (APBS), ddCOSMO, and GK models are 0.05, 0.00, and 0.00 kcal/mol,
            respectively, while the mean unsigned errors are 0.70, 0.63, and 0.58 kcal/mol, respectively.
            Validation of the electrostatic response of the resulting implicit solvents, which are available
            in the Tinker (or Tinker-HP), OpenMM, and Force Field X software packages, is based on
            comparisons to explicit solvent simulations for a series of proteins and nucleic acids.
            Overall, the emergence of performative implicit solvent models for polarizable force fields
            opens the door to their use for folding and design applications.

                    Hearing loss is associated with ?8100 mutations in 152 genes, and within the coding regions of
                    these genes are over 60,000 missense variants. The majority of these variants are classified as
                    <i>variants of uncertain significance</i>
                    to reflect our inability to ascribe a phenotypic effect to the observed amino acid change.
                    A promising source of pathogenicity information is biophysical simulation, although input protein structures
                    often contain defects because of limitations in experimental data and/or only distant homology to a template.
                    Here, we combine the polarizable atomic multipole optimized energetics for biomolecular applications force field,
                    many-body optimization theory, and graphical processing unit acceleration to repack all
                    deafness-associated proteins and thereby improve average structure MolProbity score from 2.2 to 1.0.
                    We then used these optimized wild-type models to create over 60,000 structures for missense variants in the
                    Deafness Variation Database, which are being incorporated into the Deafness Variation Database to inform
                    deafness pathogenicity prediction. Finally, this work demonstrates that advanced polarizable atomic multipole
                    force fields are efficient enough to repack the entire human proteome.

                    Many biological processes are based on molecular recognition between highly charged molecules such as nucleic acids,
                    inorganic ions, charged amino acids, etc. For such cases, it has been demonstrated that molecular simulations with
                    fixed partial charges often fail to achieve experimental accuracy. Although incorporation of more advanced
                    electrostatic models (such as multipoles, mutual polarization, etc.) can significantly improve simulation accuracy,
                    it increases computational expense by a factor of 5–20×. Indirect free energy (IFE) methods can mitigate this cost
                    by modeling intermediate states at fixed-charge resolution. For example, an efficient “reference” model such as a
                    pairwise Amber, CHARMM, or OPLS-AA force field can be used to derive an initial estimate, followed by thermodynamic
                    corrections to a more advanced “target” potential such as the polarizable AMOEBA model. Unfortunately, all currently
                    described IFE methods encounter difficulties reweighting more than ∼50 atoms between resolutions due to extensive
                    scaling of both the magnitude of the thermodynamic corrections and their statistical uncertainty. We present an
                    approach called “simultaneous bookending” (SB) that is fundamentally different from existing IFE methods based on a
                    tunable sampling approximation, which permits scaling to thousands of atoms. SB is demonstrated on the
                    relative binding affinity of Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> to a set of metalloproteins with up to 2972 atoms, finding no statistically
                    significant difference between direct AMOEBA results and those from correcting Amber to AMOEBA. The ability to
                    change the resolution of thousands of atoms during reweighting suggests the approach may be applicable in the
                    future to protein–protein binding affinities or nucleic acid thermodynamics.

                <p>First principles prediction of the structure, thermodynamics and solubility of organic molecular crystals, which play a central role in chemical, material, pharmaceutical and engineering sciences, challenges both potential energy functions and sampling methodologies. Here we calculate absolute crystal deposition thermodynamics using a novel dual force field approach whose goal is to maintain the accuracy of advanced multipole force fields (e.g. the polarizable AMOEBA model) while performing more than 95% of the sampling in an inexpensive fixed charge (FC) force field (e.g. OPLS-AA). Absolute crystal sublimation/deposition phase transition free energies were determined using an alchemical path that grows the crystalline state from a vapor reference state based on sampling with the OPLS-AA force field, followed by dual force field thermodynamic corrections to change between FC and AMOEBA resolutions at both end states (we denote the three step path as AMOEBA/FC). Importantly, whereas the phase transition requires on the order of 200 ns of sampling per compound, only 5 ns of sampling was needed for the dual force field thermodynamic corrections to reach a mean statistical uncertainty of 0.05 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>. For five organic compounds, the mean unsigned error between direct use of AMOEBA and the AMOEBA/FC dual force field path was only 0.2 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> and not statistically significant. Compared to experimental deposition thermodynamics, the mean unsigned error for AMOEBA/FC (1.4 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>) was more than a factor of two smaller than uncorrected OPLS-AA (3.2 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup>). Overall, the dual force field thermodynamic corrections reduced condensed phase sampling in the expensive force field by a factor of 40, and may prove useful for protein stability or binding thermodynamics in the future.

                <p>Molecular recognition is of paramount interest in many applications. Here we investigate a series of host–guest systems previously used in the SAMPL4 blind challenge by using molecular simulations and the AMOEBA polarizable force field. The free energy results computed by Bennett's acceptance ratio (BAR) method using the AMOEBA polarizable force field ranked favorably among the entries submitted to the SAMPL4 host–guest competition. In this work we conduct an in-depth analysis of the AMOEBA force field host–guest binding thermodynamics by using both BAR and the orthogonal space random walk (OSRW) methods. The binding entropy–enthalpy contributions are analyzed for each host–guest system. For systems of inordinate binding entropy–enthalpy values, we further examine the hydrogen bonding patterns and configurational entropy contribution. The binding mechanism of this series of host–guest systems varies from ligand to ligand, driven by enthalpy and/or entropy changes. Convergence of BAR and OSRW binding free energy methods is discussed. Ultimately, this work illustrates the value of molecular modelling and advanced force fields for the exploration and interpretation of binding thermodynamics.

                    A balance of van der Waals, electrostatic, and hydrophobic forces drive the folding and packing of
                    protein side-chains. Although residue interactions are often approximated as being pairwise additive,
                    in reality higher order ‘many-body’ contributions that depend on environment drive hydrophobic collapse
                    and cooperative electrostatics. Beginning from dead-end elimination (DEE), we derive the first algorithm
                    capable of deterministic repacking of side-chains compatible with ‘many-body’ energy functions. The
                    approach is applied to seven PCNA X-ray crystallographic data sets with resolutions 2.5-3.8 Å
                    (mean 3.0 Å). While PDB_Redo models average an R<sub>free</sub> value of 29.5% and MolProbity score
                    of 2.71 Å (77<sup>th</sup> percentile), DEE with the polarizable AMOEBA force field lowered
                    R<sub>free</sub> by 2.8% to 26.7% and improved mean MolProbity score to atomic resolution at 1.25 Å
                    (100<sup>th</sup> percentile). For applications that depend on side-chain repacking, including structure
                    refinement and protein design, the accuracy limitations of pairwise additivity can now be eliminated
                    via polarizable or quantum mechanical potentials.

                    Molecular mechanics based modeling has been widely used in the study of chemical and
                    biological systems. The classical potential energy functions and their parameters are
                    referred to as force fields. Empirical force fields for biomolecules emerged in the early
                    1970's, followed by the first molecular dynamics simulations of the bovine pancreatic
                    trypsin inhibitors (BPTI). Over the past 30 years, a great number of empirical
                    molecular mechanics force fields, including AMBER, CHARMM, GROMOS, OPLS,
                    and many others, have been developed. These force fields share similar functional forms,
                    including valence interactions represented by harmonic oscillators, point dispersionrepulsion
                    for van der Waals (vdW) interactions, and an electrostatic contribution based
                    on fixed atomic partial charges. This generation of molecular mechanics force fields has
                    been widely used in the study of molecular structures, dynamics, interactions, design and
                    engineering.

                    We present for the first time polarizable molecular dynamics (MD) simulations within a polarizable
                    continuum solvent with molecular shape cavities and exact solution of the mutual polarization.
                    The key ingredients are a very efficient algorithm for solving the equations associated with the
                    polarizable continuum, in particular, the domain decomposition Conductor-like Screening Model (ddCOSMO),
                    a rigorous coupling of the continuum with the polarizable force field achieved through a robust
                    variational formulation and an effective strategy to solve the coupled equations. The coupling of
                    ddCOSMO with non variational force fields, including AMOEBA, is also addressed. The MD simulations
                    are feasible, for real life systems, on standard cluster nodes; a scalable parallel implementation
                    allows for further speed up in the context of a newly developed module in Tinker, named Tinker-HP.
                    NVE simulations are stable and long term energy conservation can be achieved. This paper is focused
                    on the methodological developments, on the analysis of the algorithm and on the stability of the
                    simulations; a proof-of-concept application is also presented to attest the possibilities of this
                    newly developed technique.

                    The solubility of organic molecules is of critical importance to the pharmaceutical industry,
                    however, robust computational methods to predict this quantity from first principles are lacking.
                    Solubility can be computed from a thermodynamic cycle that decomposes standard state solubility into the
                    sum of solid-vapor sublimation and vapor-liquid solvation free energies ΔG°
                    <sub>solubility</sub> = ΔG°
                    <sub>sub</sub> + ΔG°
                    <sub>solv</sub>.
                    Over the past few decades, alchemical simulation methods to compute solvation free energy using
                    classical force fields have become widely used. However, analogous methods for determining the free
                    energy of the sublimation/deposition phase transition are currently limited by the necessity of a
                    priori knowledge of the atomic coordinates of the crystal. Here we describe progress toward an
                    alternative scheme based on growth of the asymmetric unit into a crystal via alchemy (GAUCHE).
                    GAUCHE computes deposition free energy ΔG°<sub>dep</sub>=-ΔG°<sub>sub</sub>=
                    k<sub>B</sub>Tln(V<sub>AU</sub>⁄1  M) + ΔG°<sub>AU</sub> + ΔG°<sub>(AU→UC)</sub>
                    as the sum of an entropic term to account for compressing a 1 M vapor into the molar volume of the crystal
                    asymmetric unit (VAU), where kB is Boltzmann’s constant and T is temperature in degrees Kelvin, plus two
                    simulation steps. In the first simulation step, the deposition free energy ΔG°<sub>AU</sub> for a system
                    composed of only NAU asymmetric unit (AU) molecule(s) is computed beginning from an arbitrary conformation
                    in vacuum. In the second simulation step, the change in free energy ΔG°<sub>(AU→UC)</sub> to expand the
                    asymmetric unit degrees of freedom into a unit cell (UC) composed of NUC independent molecules is computed.
                    This latter step accounts for the favorable free energy of removing the constraint that every symmetry mate
                    of the asymmetric unit has an identical conformation and intermolecular interactions. The current work is
                    based on NVT simulations, which requires knowledge of the crystal space group and unit cell parameters
                    from experiment, but not a priori knowledge of crystalline atomic coordinates. GAUCHE was applied to 5
                    organic molecules whose sublimation free energy has been measured experimentally, based on the polarizable
                    atomic multipole AMOEBA force field and more than a microsecond of sampling per compound. The mean signed
                    and unsigned errors were only -0.4 and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively, which indicates that GAUCHE is capable
                    of accurately predicts sublimation thermodynamics.

                    In this paper, we investigate various numerical strategies to compute the direct space polarization
                    energy and associated forces in the context of the point dipole approximation (including damping)
                    used in polarizable molecular dynamics. We present a careful mathematical analysis of the algorithms
                    that have been implemented in popular production packages and applied to large test systems. We show
                    that the classical Jacobi Over-Relaxation method (JOR) should not be used as its convergence requires
                    a proper value of the relaxation parameter, whereas other strategies should be preferred. On a single
                    node, Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient methods (PCG) and Jacobi algorithm coupled with the Direct
                    Inversion in the Iterative Subspace (JI/DIIS) provide reliable stability/convergence and are roughly
                    twice as fast as JOR. Moreover, both algorithms are suitable for massively parallel implementations.
                    The lower requirements in terms of processes communications make JI/DIIS the method of choice for MPI
                    and hybrid OpenMP/MPI paradigms for real life tests. Furthermore, using a predictor step as a guess
                    along a molecular dynamics simulation provides another inexpensive, yet very effective, form of
                    convergence acceleration. Overall, two to three orders of magnitude in time can be gained compared
                    to the initial JOR single node approach to the final PGC or JI/DIIS parallel one combined with the
                    predictors MD refinements. Such a speedup traces a new route for the high performance implementation
                    of polarizable molecular dynamics and therefore extends the applicability of the technique as it will
                    facilitate future multiscale QM/MM/continuum computations.

                    An understanding of molecular interactions is essential for insight into biological systems at the
                    molecular scale. Among the various components of molecular interactions, electrostatics are of special
                    importance because of their long-range nature and their influence on polar or charged molecules,
                    including water, aqueous ions, proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and membrane lipids. In
                    particular, robust models of electrostatic interactions are essential for understanding the solvation
                    properties of biomolecules and the effects of solvation upon biomolecular folding, binding, enzyme
                    catalysis, and dynamics. Electrostatics, therefore, are of central importance to understanding
                    biomolecular structure and modeling interactions within and among biological molecules. This review
                    discusses the solvation of biomolecules with a computational biophysics view toward describing the

                    An important unsolved problem in materials science is prediction of the thermodynamic
                    stability of organic crystals and their solubility from first principles. Solubility can
                    be defined as the saturating concentration of a molecule within a liquid solvent, where
                    the physical picture is of solvated molecules in equilibrium with their solid phase. Despite
                    the importance of solubility in determining the oral bioavailability of pharmaceuticals,
                    prediction tools are currently limited to quantitative structure–property relationships that
                    are fit to experimental solubility measurements. For the first time, we describe a consistent
                    procedure for the prediction of the structure, thermodynamic stability, and solubility of
                    organic crystals from molecular dynamics simulations using the polarizable multipole AMOEBA
                    force field. Our approach is based on a thermodynamic cycle that decomposes standard state
                    solubility into the sum of solid–vapor sublimation and vapor–liquid solvation free energies
                    ΔG°
                    <sub>solubility</sub> = ΔG°
                    <sub>sub</sub> + ΔG°
                    <sub>solv</sub>, which are computed via the
                    orthogonal space random walk (OSRW) sampling strategy. Application to the n-alkylamides series
                    from acetamide through octanamide was selected due to the dependence of their solubility on both
                    amide hydrogen bonding and the hydrophobic effect, which are each fundamental to protein structure
                    and solubility. On average, the calculated absolute standard state solubility free energies are
                    accurate to within 1.1 kcal/mol. The experimental trend of decreasing solubility as a function
                    of n-alkylamide chain length is recapitulated by the increasing stability of the crystalline
                    state and to a lesser degree by decreasing favorability of solvation (i.e., the hydrophobic effect).
                    Our results suggest that coupling the polarizable AMOEBA force field with an orthogonal space
                    based free energy algorithm, as implemented in the program

                    is highly conserved in the 500 plus representatives of the human protein kinase
                    family. Here we review progress toward the development of non-ATP competitive MAP
                    kinase inhibitors for the extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERK1/2),
                    the c-jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1/2/3) and the p38 MAPKs (α, β, γ, and δ).
                    Special emphasis is placed on the role of computational methods in the drug
                    discovery process for MAP kinases. Topics include recent advances in X-ray
                    crystallography theory that improve the MAP kinase structures essential to
                    structurebased drug discovery, the use of molecular dynamics to understand the
                    conformational heterogeneity of the activation loop and inhibitors discovered by
                    virtual screening. The impact of an advanced polarizable force field such as
                    AMOEBA used in conjunction with sophisticated kinetic and thermodynamic simulation
                    methods is also discussed.

                <p>
                    In the past, weighting between the sum of chemical and data-based targets in
                    macromolecular crystallographic refinement was based on comparing the gradients or Hessian
                    diagonal terms of the two potential functions. Here we demonstrate limitations of
                    this scheme, especially in the context of a maximum likelihood target that is inherently
                    weighted by the model and data errors. In fact, the congruence between the maximum
                    likelihood target and a chemical potential based on polarizable atomic multipole
                    electrostatics evaluated with Ewald summation has opened the door to a transferable,
                    static weight. We derive from first principles an optimal static weight and demonstrate
                    that it is transferable across a broad range of data resolutions in the context
                    of our recent implementation of X-ray crystallographic refinement using the polarizable
                    AMOEBA force field and show the resulting models are balanced with respect
                    to optimizing both R
                    <sub>free</sub> and Molprobity scores. Conversely, the classical automatic
                    weighting scheme is shown to lead to under or overfitting of the data and poor model geometry.
                    We also highlight the benefits of this approach for low resolution diffraction
                    data, where the need for prior chemical information is of particular importance. We
                    demonstrate that this method is transferable between low and high resolution maximum
                    likelihood based crystallographic refinement, which proves for the first time that
                    resolution dependent parameterization of either the weight or chemical potential is
                    unnecessary.

                    Most current crystallographic structure refinements augment the diffraction data
                    with a priori information consisting of bond, angle, dihedral, planarity
                    restraints, and atomic repulsion based on the Pauli exclusion principle. Yet,
                    electrostatics and van der Waals attraction are physical forces that provide
                    additional a priori information. Here, we assess the inclusion of electrostatics
                    for the force field used for all-atom (including hydrogen) joint neutron/X-ray
                    refinement. Two DNA and a protein crystal structure were refined against joint
                    neutron/X-ray diffraction data sets using force fields without electrostatics or
                    with electrostatics. Hydrogen-bond orientation/geometry favors the inclusion of
                    electrostatics. Refinement of Z-DNA with electrostatics leads to a hypothesis
                    for the entropic stabilization of Z-DNA that may partly explain the
                    thermodynamics of converting the B form of DNA to its Z form. Thus, inclusion of
                    electrostatics assists joint neutron/X-ray refinements, especially for placing
                    and orienting hydrogen atoms.

                    Refinement of macromolecular models from X-ray crystallography experiments
                    benefits from prior chemical knowledge at all resolutions. As the quality of
                    the prior chemical knowledge from quantum or classical molecular physics
                    improves, in principle so will resulting structural models. Due to limitations
                    in computer performance and electrostatic algorithms, commonly used
                    macromolecules X-ray crystallography refinement protocols have had limited
                    support for rigorous molecular physics in the past. For example, electrostatics
                    is often neglected in favor of nonbonded interactions based on a purely repulsive
                    van der Waals potential. In this work we present advanced algorithms for desktop
                    workstations that open the door to X-ray refinement of even the most challenging
                    macromolecular data sets using state-of-the-art classical molecular physics.
                    First we describe theory for particle mesh Ewald (PME) summation that
                    consistently handles the symmetry of all 230 space groups, replicates of the
                    unit cell such that the minimum image convention can be used with a real space
                    cutoff of any size and the combination of space group symmetry with replicates.
                    An implementation of symmetry accelerated PME for the polarizable atomic
                    multipole optimized energetics for biomolecular applications (AMOEBA) force
                    field is presented. Relative to a single CPU core performing calculations on a
                    P1 unit cell, our AMOEBA engine called
                    <b>

                    GPU coprocessor for 30 structures that contain 240000 atoms on average in the
                    unit cell. The benefit of AMOEBA electrostatics evaluated with PME for
                    macromolecular X-ray crystallography refinement is demonstrated via rerefinement
                    of 10 crystallographic data sets that range in resolution from 1.7 to 4.5 Å.
                    Beginning from structures obtained by local optimization without electrostatics,
                    further optimization using AMOEBA with PME electrostatics improved agreement of
                    the model with the data (R
                    <sub>free</sub> was lowered by 0.5%), improved geometric features
                    such as favorable (φ,ψ) backbone conformations, and lowered the average potential
                    energy per residue by over 10 kcal/mol. Furthermore, the MolProbity structure validation
                    tool indicates that the geometry of these rerefined structures is consistent with X-ray
                    crystallographic data collected up to 2.2 Å, which is 0.9 Å better than the actual mean
                    quality (3.1 Å). We conclude that polarizable AMOEBA-assisted X-ray refinement offers
                    advantages to methods that neglect electrostatics and is now efficient enough for routine
                    use.

                    Inclusion of low-resolution data in macromolecular crystallography requires a
                    model for the bulk solvent. Previous methods have used a binary mask to
                    accomplish this, which has proven to be very effective, but the mask is
                    discontinuous at the solute–solvent boundary (i.e. the mask value jumps from
                    zero to one) and is not differentiable with respect to atomic parameters.
                    Here, two algorithms are introduced for computing bulk-solvent models using
                    either a polynomial switch or a smoothly thresholded product of Gaussians,
                    and both models are shown to be efficient and differentiable with respect to
                    atomic coordinates. These alternative bulk-solvent models offer algorithmic
                    improvements, while showing similar agreement of the model with the observed
                    amplitudes relative to the binary model as monitored using R, R
                    <sub>free</sub> and
                    differences between experimental and model phases. As with the standard solvent
                    models, the alternative models improve the agreement primarily with lower
                    resolution (>6 Å) data versus no bulk solvent. The models are easily implemented
                    into crystallographic software packages and can be used as a general method for
                    bulk-solvent correction in macromolecular crystallography.

                    We recently developed a polarizable atomic multipole refinement method assisted
                    by the AMOEBA force field for macromolecular crystallography. Compared to
                    standard refinement procedures, the method uses a more rigorous treatment of
                    X-ray scattering and electrostatics that can significantly improve the resultant
                    information contained in an atomic model. We applied this method to
                    high-resolution lysozyme and trypsin data sets, and validated its utility for
                    precisely describing biomolecular electron density, as indicated by a 0.4–0.6%
                    decrease in the R- and R
                    <sub>free</sub>-values, and a corresponding decrease in the
                    relative energy of 0.4–0.8 Kcal/mol/residue. The re-refinements illustrate the
                    ability of force field electrostatics to orient water networks and catalytically
                    relevant hydrogens, which can be used to make predictions regarding active site

                    Molecular force fields have been approaching a generational transition over the
                    past several years, moving away from well-established and well-tuned, but
                    intrinsically limited, fixed point charge models toward more intricate and
                    expensive polarizable models that should allow more accurate description of
                    molecular properties. The recently introduced AMOEBA force field is a leading
                    publicly available example of this next generation of theoretical model, but to
                    date, it has only received relatively limited validation, which we address here.
                    We show that the AMOEBA force field is in fact a significant improvement over
                    fixed charge models for small molecule structural and thermodynamic observables
                    in particular, although further fine-tuning is necessary to describe solvation
                    free energies of drug-like small molecules, dynamical properties away from
                    ambient conditions, and possible improvements in aromatic interactions. State of
                    the art electronic structure calculations reveal generally very good agreement
                    with AMOEBA for demanding problems such as relative conformational energies of
                    the alanine tetrapeptide and isomers of water sulfate complexes. AMOEBA is shown
                    to be especially successful on protein−ligand binding and computational X-ray
                    crystallography where polarization and accurate electrostatics are critical.

                    Recent advances in computational chemistry have produced force fields based on a polarizable
                    atomic multipole description of biomolecular electrostatics. In this work, the Atomic
                    Multipole Optimized Energetics for Biomolecular Applications (AMOEBA) force field is applied
                    to restrained refinement of molecular models against X-ray diffraction data from peptide
                    crystals. A new formalism is also developed to compute anisotropic and aspherical structure
                    factors using fast Fourier transformation (FFT) of Cartesian Gaussian multipoles. Relative
                    to direct summation, the FFT approach can give a speedup of more than an order of magnitude
                    for aspherical refinement of ultrahigh-resolution data sets. Use of a sublattice formalism

                    AMOEBA force field demonstrates that AMOEBA systematically underestimates electron density
                    at bond centers. For the trigonal and tetrahedral bonding geometries common in organic
                    chemistry, an atomic multipole expansion through hexadecapole order is required to explain
                    bond electron density. Alternatively, the addition of interatomic scattering (IAS) sites to
                    the AMOEBA-based density captured bonding effects with fewer parameters. For a series of
                    four peptide crystals, the AMOEBA-IAS model lowered R
                    <sub>free</sub> by 20-40% relative to the original
                    spherically symmetric scattering model.

                    The binding free energies of several benzamidine-like inhibitors to trypsin were examined
                    using a polarizable molecular mechanics potential. All the computed binding free energies
                    are in good agreement with the experimental data. From free energy decomposition,
                    electrostatic interaction was indicated to be the driving force for the binding. MD
                    simulations show that the ligands form hydrogen bonds with trypsin and water molecules
                    nearby in a competitive fashion. While the binding free energy is independent of the ligand
                    dipole moment, it shows a strong correlation with the ligand molecular polarizability.

                    We have calculated the binding free energies of a series of benzamidine-like inhibitors to
                    trypsin with a polarizable force field using both explicit and implicit solvent approaches.
                    Free energy perturbation has been performed for the ligands in bulk water and in protein
                    complex with molecular dynamics simulations. The binding free energies calculated from
                    explicit solvent simulations are well within the accuracy of experimental measurement and
                    the direction of change is predicted correctly in all cases. We analyzed the molecular
                    dipole moments of the ligands in gas, water and protein environments. Neither binding
                    affinity nor ligand solvation free energy in bulk water shows much dependence on the
                    molecular dipole moments of the ligands. Substitution of the aromatic or the charged group
                    in the ligand results in considerable change in the solvation energy in bulk water and
                    protein whereas the binding affinity varies insignificantly due to cancellation. The effect
                    of chemical modification on ligand charge distribution is mostly local. Replacing benzene
                    with diazine has minimal impact on the atomic multipoles at the amidinium group. We have
                    also utilized an implicit solvent based end-state approach to evaluate the binding free
                    energies of these inhibitors. In this approach, the polarizable multipole model combined
                    with Poisson-Boltzmann/surface area (PMPB/SA) provides the electrostatic interaction energy
                    and the polar solvation free energy. Overall the relative binding free energies obtained
                    from the MM-PMPB/SA model are in good agreement with the experimental data.

                    The generalized Born (GB) model of continuum electrostatics is an analytic approximation to
                    the Poisson equation useful for predicting the electrostatic component of the solvation free
                    energy for solutes ranging in size from small organic molecules to large macromolecular
                    complexes. This work presents a new continuum electrostatics model based on Kirkwood's
                    analytic result for the electrostatic component of the solvation free energy for a solute
                    with arbitrary charge distribution. Unlike GB, which is limited to monopoles, our
                    generalized Kirkwood (GK) model can treat solute electrostatics represented by any
                    combination of permanent and induced atomic multipole moments of arbitrary degree.
                    Here we apply the GK model to the newly developed Atomic Multipole Optimized Energetics for
                    Biomolecular Applications (AMOEBA) force field, which includes permanent atomic multipoles
                    through the quadrupole and treats polarization via induced dipoles. A derivation of the GK
                    gradient is presented, which enables energy minimization or molecular dynamics of an AMOEBA
                    solute within a GK continuum. For a series of 55 proteins, GK electrostatic solvation free
                    energies are compared to the Polarizable Multipole Poisson−Boltzmann (PMPB) model and yield
                    a mean unsigned relative difference of 0.9%. Additionally, the reaction field of GK compares
                    well to that of the PMPB model, as shown by a mean unsigned relative difference of 2.7% in
                    predicting the total solvated dipole moment for each protein in this test set. The CPU time
                    needed for GK relative to vacuum AMOEBA calculations is approximately a factor of 3, making
                    it suitable for applications that require significant sampling of configuration space.

                    Modeling the change in the electrostatics of organic molecules upon moving from vacuum into
                    solvent, due to polarization, has long been an interesting problem. In vacuum, experimental
                    values for the dipole moments and polarizabilities of small, rigid molecules are known to
                    high accuracy; however, it has generally been difficult to determine these quantities for a
                    polar molecule in water. A theoretical approach introduced by Onsager
                    [ J. Am. Chem. Soc. 58, 1486 (1936) ]
                    used vacuum properties of small molecules, including polarizability, dipole moment, and
                    size, to predict experimentally known permittivities of neat liquids via the Poisson
                    equation. Since this important advance in understanding the condensed phase, a large number
                    of computational methods have been developed to study solutes embedded in a continuum via
                    numerical solutions to the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Only recently have the classical
                    force fields used for studying biomolecules begun to include explicit polarization in their
                    functional forms. Here the authors describe the theory underlying a newly developed
                    polarizable multipole Poisson-Boltzmann (PMPB) continuum electrostatics model, which builds
                    on the atomic multipole optimized energetics for biomolecular applications (AMOEBA) force
                    field. As an application of the PMPB methodology, results are presented for several small
                    folded proteins studied by molecular dynamics in explicit water as well as embedded in the
                    PMPB continuum. The dipole moment of each protein increased on average by a factor of 1.27
                    in explicit AMOEBA water and 1.26 in continuum solvent. The essentially identical
                    electrostatic response in both models suggests that PMPB electrostatics offers an efficient
                    alternative to sampling explicit solvent molecules for a variety of interesting
                    applications, including binding energies, conformational analysis, and pKa prediction.
                    Introduction of 150 mM salt lowered the electrostatic solvation energy between 2 and 13
                    kcal/mole, depending on the formal charge of the protein, but had only a small influence
                    on dipole moments.
